My path to becoming a Quantum Engineer at 16.
I am learning Quantum Computing from scratch. Here I explore basic gates and state transformations.

 My Quantum Journey 2025
This repository contains my daily progress in Quantum Computing.

## Contents:
- **CNOT Experiment**: Testing state relocation logic.
- **Z-Gate**: Learning how to change phase (the "Filter" concept).

- ### 01_cnot_train_relocation.ipynb
**Description:** 
In this experiment, I use the "Train Analogy" to understand Matrix Multiplication (Linear Algebra).

**How it works:**
* **Entrance (Top):** The columns represent the starting "stations" (Input States).
* **The Path:** The state travels down the column like a train on a track.
* **Exit (Left):** When the train hits a "1" (the switch), it turns left and arrives at a new station (Output State).

**Physical meaning:**
This shows how the CNOT gate relocates quantum information from one state to another based on the control qubit.

- ### 03_qutip_matplotlip.ipynb
**Description:** 
My first encounter with the qutip library and adding real physics to the graph. Before, there were photographs; now it's a film strip, where you can use the graph to see what happens to the qubit over time. Next, adding friction and noise.
